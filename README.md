Small app that uses News API to fetch top headlines from the chosen topic. It contains component to display results in Bootstrap cards and search component so that user can enter a query.

Developed with React, HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap. Utilizes React (Hooks) functional components instead of class based components. Create .env file and replace Api key with your own.

More user friendly error handling will be added later.
